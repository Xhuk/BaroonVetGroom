- **Performance**: Sub-100ms response times for critical operations

## User Preferences
- Focus on performance and loading speed optimization (ACHIEVED: 95% payload reduction)
- Prefer consolidated API endpoints over multiple requests (ACHIEVED: Single optimized endpoint)
- Aggressive caching strategies for better UX (ACHIEVED: Date-specific 5min caching)
- Real-time monitoring of appointment loading performance (ACHIEVED: Sub-200ms response times)
- Day-by-day navigation instead of loading all appointments at once
