// RESOLUTION: React hooks order violation in ResponsiveNavigation component - FIXED
// Date: 2025-08-08 15:20:05
// Error: "Rendered more hooks than during the previous render" - RESOLVED

// PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
// - Early return `if (isTabletLandscape) return null;` was placed BEFORE useQuery hooks
// - This caused hooks to be called in different order between renders
// - React Rules of Hooks violation: hooks must always be called in the same order

// SOLUTION APPLIED:
// - Moved ALL useQuery hooks to be called BEFORE any early returns
// - Ensures consistent hooks order across all render cycles
// - Maintains component functionality while fixing React compliance

// VERIFICATION:
// - Component now follows Rules of Hooks correctly
// - No more "Rendered more hooks than during the previous render" error
// - Responsive navigation continues to work as expected

// STATUS: FIXED - React hooks order compliance restored
